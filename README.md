# Suicide-detection-app

Our Social media is filled with different kinds of feed including entertainment, news,memes, pictures,sports or friends and stuff. Social media refers to being able to access and share information, ideas,feelings and news through virtual communication.Some of these thoughts be like feeling alone,feeling trapped, expressing how hopeless theyare or feeling alone and so on.So,Our aim is to develop a system for the early identification of suicide ideation based on his/her posts and comments on social media which helps to prevent suicide in theearly stages.We use different machine learning and Natural Language Processingtechniques to classify text into suicidal and non-suicidal text and detecting the risk of suicides.We train the model using the data to be able to classify the messages intosuicidal or non-suicidal when given in the real-time.We mainly design a web page to take a message like “I am happy” or “I want to leave this world” and so on from the user and predicts output whether the message issuicidal or non-suicidal.If the output is “suicidal”,the page leads the user to a chat-bot
to talk to and help the user to overcome such thoughts
